# AI Pinboard

A Python application that processes YouTube videos, creates summaries, and posts them to Pinboard and Pastebin.

The Youtube Summary is generated by AI.
The Tags are generated by AI.
The Short summary is generated by AI.
The Long Summary is posted to Pastebin.
There is then a Pinboard entry created with the short summary and a link to the Pastebin entry in the Description. The Link to Pinboard will be the same as the title of the Youtube video and the link is to the video on Youtube.

## Usage

### YouTube

The YouTube processing uses the One Minute AI API.

A Title, Summary, and Tags are generated by AI.
This is then posted to Pinboard.
There is a Pastebin entry created for the summary.
The link to the Pastebin entry is added to the Pinboard entry in the description.

Run the application with a YouTube URL:

```bash
python app.py youtube --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"
```

Run the application with a YouTube URL and additional tags:
By default tags are auto generated but you can add extra tags if you need them.

```bash
python app.py youtube --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" --tags "tag1, tag2, tag3"
```

#### Example Youtube Pastebin Output

A Title, Summary, and Tags are generated by AI.
