# AI Pinboard

A Python application that processes YouTube videos, creates summaries, and posts them to Pinboard and Pastebin.

The Youtube Summary is generated by AI.
The Tags are generated by AI.
The Short summary is generated by AI.
The Long Summary is posted to Pastebin.
There is then a Pinboard entry created with the short summary and a link to the Pastebin entry in the Description. The Link to Pinboard will be the same as the title of the Youtube video and the link is to the video on Youtube.

## Features

- Extracts information from YouTube videos
- Generates AI-powered summaries using [One Minute AI](https://1min.ai/)
- Posts summaries to Pastebin
- Creates bookmarks on Pinboard with summaries and tags
- Supports environment variables for API keys

## Requirements

- Python 3.12.3 or higher
- [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)
- API keys for:
  - One Minute AI
  - Pastebin
  - Pinboard

## Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
uv sync
```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following:

```env
ONE_MIN_AI_API_KEY=your_key_here
ONE_MIN_CHAT_CONVERSATION_ID=your_key_here
PASTEBIN_API_KEY=your_key_here
PINBOARD_API_KEY=your_key_here
PASTEBIN_USERNAME=your_username_here
PASTEBIN_PASSWORD=your_password_here
```

For `ONE_MIN_CHAT_CONVERSATION_ID`, you need to create a conversation with One Minute AI. The conversation ID is the last part of the URL when you are in the conversation. For example, if the URL is `https://app.1min.ai/chat-with-ai/123456789`, then the conversation ID is `123456789`.

## Usage

Run the application with a YouTube URL:

```bash
python app.py youtube --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example"
```

Run the application with a YouTube URL and additional tags:
By default tags are auto generated but you can add extra tags if you need them.

```bash
python app.py youtube --url "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=example" --tags "tag1, tag2, tag3"
```
